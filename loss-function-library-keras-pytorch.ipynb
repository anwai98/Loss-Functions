    "# Loss Function Reference for Keras & PyTorch\n",
    "---\n",
    "This kernel provides a reference library for some popular custom loss functions that you can easily import into your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss functions define how neural network models calculate the overall error from their residuals for each training batch. This in turn affects how they adjust their internal weights when performing backpropagation, so the choice of loss function has a direct influence on model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default choice of loss function for segmentation and other classification tasks is Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE). In situations where a particular metric, like the Dice Coefficient or Intersection over Union (IoU), is being used to judge model performance, competitors will sometimes experiment with loss functions that derive from these metrics - typically in the form `1 - f(x)` where `f(x)` is the metric in question. \n",
    "\n",
    "These functions cannot simply be written in NumPy, as they must operate on tensors that also have gradient parameters which need to be calculated throughout the model during backpropagation. Accordingly, loss functions must be written using backend functions from the respective model library. This is less complicated than it sounds! For example in Keras, you would simply use the same familiar mathematical functions, albeit using the Keras backend imported as `K`, i.e `K.sum()`. Gradient calculation is handled automatically by the model libraries, although (at least in PyTorch) you can define this manually if you are confident in your mathematical ability and wish to make alterations of your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "With multi-class classification or segmentation, we sometimes use loss functions that calculate the average loss for each class, rather than calculating loss from the prediction tensor as a whole. This kernel is meant as a template reference for the basic code, so all examples calculate loss on the entire tensor, but it should be trivial for you to modify it for multi-class averaging. \n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this kernel will be of use to you, and any corrections or suggestions are welcome."

    "* Tversky and Focal-Tversky loss benefit from very low learning rates, of the order 5e-5 to 1e-4. They would not see much improvement in my kernels until around 7-10 epochs, upon which performance would improve significantly.\n",

If you call a function to modify the inputs that doesn't entirely use PyTorch's numerical methods, the tensor will 'detach' from the the graph that maps it back through the neural network for the purposes of backpropagation, making the loss function unusable.
